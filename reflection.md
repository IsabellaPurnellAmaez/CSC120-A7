- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?

I thought it was really helpful and easy to pick up. It makes it a lot simpler to code a lot of similar objects by making a base for all of them just one time and then adding specific attributes and methods rather than starting from scratch every single time. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I had the hardest time with library because I didn't really know much about how to implement hashmaps. I think it came up a little in previous homeworks but I was not super familiar with the methods I needed to use. I also struggled a little bit with Cafe restock. I chose to have it just restock each thing when it runs out instead of restocking everything every time. 

I also think some of my exeptions will work but will stop the program. I tried to implement try catch blocks but I was having a hard time. This is because the requirements for the class doesn't throw an exception.
